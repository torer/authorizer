Authorizer limits login attempts, restricts access to specified users, and authenticates against external sources (e.g., Google, LDAP, or CAS).

== Description ==

*Authorizer* restricts access to a WordPress site to specific users, typically students enrolled in a university course. It maintains a list of approved users that you can edit to determine who has access. It also replaces the default WordPress login/authorization system with one relying on an external server, such as Google, CAS, or LDAP. Finally, *Authorizer* lets you limit invalid login attempts to prevent bots from compromising your users' accounts.

View or contribute to the plugin source on Github: [https://github.com/uhm-coe/authorizer](https://github.com/uhm-coe/authorizer)

*Authorizer* requires the following:

* **CAS server** (2.x, 3.x, 4.x, or 5.x) or **LDAP server** (plugin needs the URL)
* PHP extensions: php-ldap, php-curl, php-dom

*Authorizer* provides the following options:

* **Authentication**: WordPress accounts; Google accounts; CAS accounts; LDAP accounts
* **Login Access**: All authenticated users (all local and all external can log in); Only specific users (all local and approved external users can log in)
* **View Access**: Everyone (open access); Only logged in users
* **Limit Login Attempts**: Progressively increase the amount of time required between invalid login attempts.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `authorizer` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Specify your server details in the 'Settings' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help! I've disabled WordPress logins, my external logins (Google/CAS/LDAP) aren't working, and now I can't get back in! =

If you add external=wordpress to the wp-login.php URL querystring, you can always get the WordPress login form to reappear. For example, if your site is at [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com), then the URL would be: [https://www.example.com/wp-login.php?external=wordpress](https://www.example.com/wp-login.php?external=wordpress)

= Where is this plugin used? =

The [University of Hawai'i][uh], which provides authentication for student, faculty, and staff members via a centralized service (CAS or LDAP).

== Changelog ==

= 2.7.2 =
* Fix Approved User list sort when set to Date approved / Descending (was still showing as ascending).
* Support multiple LDAP search bases. Props @jmutsaerts for the feature request.

= 2.7.1 =
* Compatibility fix for PHP < 5.5. Props @klausdk for the report!
* Additional fix for role not getting set when adding an existing user to a site in multisite. Props @julienlusson for the fix!

= 2.7.0 =

* Feature: Paging, sorting, and searching in the Approved User list for sites with many users (finally!).
* Update LDAP TLS option for clarity. Props @Scriptkiddi for the pull request!
* Support deprecated multisite constant BLOGID_CURRENT_SITE in addition to BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE. Props @er2576 for tracking that down!

* Fix for updating approved list entry when an email address change is made on the WordPress user profile page in a multisite environment.
* Fix for role not getting set when creating and adding a new user to a blog in multisite. Props @julienlusson for the report and @pkarjala for the fix!

= 2.6.23 =
* Added ability to disable the dashboard widget (useful on sites with many users until paged user lists are implemented).
* Fix for the multisite option override link always going to the External Services tab.
* Fix for hide/show of Login Access options when certain options are selected.

= 2.6.22 =
* Fix for regression showing certain private posts. Props @InvisibleMass for finding the bug!
* Fix for users without the php-mbstring extension installed.
* Update jQuery multi-select plugin from 0.9.8 to 0.9.12.
* Fix for bug in syncing user roles during login. Props @dsusco for the pull request!

= 2.6.21 =
* Fix broken logins caused by regression on previous fix for multivalued email attribute

= 2.6.20 =
* Fix for issue with incorrect parsing of an array of email addresses to be converted to lowercase.
* Fix for nonce cookie issue on google logins where cookie was being sent after headers, resulting in an error message.

= 2.6.19 =
* Fix for issue with case sensitivity checks on user emails affecting role assignments, user deletions, and user updates in Authorizer.  All existing uppercase emails in Authorizer will migrate to lowercase as users log in.  Thank you again to @mmcglynn for continued extensive help in testing.
* Update CAS server connection check to accept 300 response codes as valid presence of a CAS server.  It is the administrator's duty to ensure that a redirect on their CAS url is acceptable.

= 2.6.18 =
* Fix for issue with approved list roles not updating correctly when changed using the authorizer_custom_role hook.  Thank you to @mmcglynn for extensive help in testing.
* Fix for issue with removing user's roles when removing them from a multisite WordPress install.

= 2.6.17 =
* Fix for approved list roles not updating if changed on the fly in authorizer_custom_role hook.
* Update phpCAS from 1.3.4 to 1.3.5. See [changelog](https://github.com/Jasig/phpCAS/blob/master/docs/ChangeLog).

= 2.6.16 =
* Fix: Remove user's role when removing them from the approved list. This is a security feature, in case a removed user is presumed deleted from the site. Since Authorizer does not delete users (to avoid the issue of reassigning or deleting that user’s content), removing their role removes all capabilities from the site until they are re-added to the approved list.

= 2.6.15 =
* Fix for duplicate users in approved list (users added via authorizer_automatically_approve_login filter were re-added to approved list each time they logged in).

= 2.6.14 =
* Move nonce cookie creation to the first time it is needed (for Google logins). Props @emsearcy for the pull request!

= 2.6.13 =
* Respect redirect_to param on CAS logout (if param exists). Props @dgoldber for finding that!

= 2.6.12 =
* Better detection of fuzzy permalink matches for private pages. Applies if site is restricted but 404 pages are marked as public; if this was the case, anonymous visitors to malformed permalinks (e.g., “example.com/sample page” or “example.com/sample%20page” instead of “example.com/sample-page”) were able to see the restricted page. Props @6hogan for finding that!

= 2.6.11 =
* Fix for CAS logins redirecting to the redirect_to param of wp-login.php.
* Fix for redirect after CAS logout on some CAS servers requiring whitelisted services (add a trailing slash to the logout service param).

= 2.6.10 =
* Allow multiple whitelisted domains under Google Hosted Domain. Props Michael K. for the suggestion!
* Drop php-mcrypt library dependency (use openssl library instead since mcrypt is deprecated as of PHP 7.1).
* Fix for some CAS servers redirecting to improper WordPress destination. Props @asithade for the [pull request](https://github.com/uhm-coe/authorizer/pull/29)!
* Fix for mixed-case LDAP attribute names (first name, last name, email) not being recognized because ldap_get_entries() returns attirbute names in lowercase. Props @yatesconsulting for the [report](https://github.com/uhm-coe/authorizer/issues/27)!
* Fix for immediate CAS redirect hook firing after content was sent to browser, triggering a PHP warning if output buffering isn't enabled on the web server. Props @steven1350 for reporting the bug!

= 2.6.9 =
* Fix for LDAP logins failing if the user password contained a single quote, double quote, or a backslash. Props @alxbr for the research!

= 2.6.8 =
* Fix for edge case where a network approved user wouldn't be allowed to visit wp-admin on a site they had not been added to yet.
* Fix for quotation marks in LDAP password causing LDAP bind to fail.
* Fix for issues with marking translated (via WPML) categories public. Props @mafoti for the pull request!
* Fix for placeholder text for plugin option fields being mistaken for actual values. Props @pkarjala for the pull request!
* Fix for blocked flag in usermeta not getting removed when unblocking a user.
* Feature: Add filter to inspect CAS attributes and automatically approve a user based on any values there. Example:
```
/**
 * Filter whether to automatically approve the currently logging in user
 * based on any of their user attributes.
 *
 * @param bool  $automatically_approve_login
 *   Whether to automatically approve the currently logging in user.
 * @param array $user_data User data returned from external service.
 */
function approve_all_faculty_logins( $automatically_approve_login, $user_data ) {
  // Automatically approve logins for all faculty members.
  if (
    isset( $user_data['cas_attributes']['eduPersonAffiliation'] ) &&
    'faculty' === $user_data['cas_attributes']['eduPersonAffiliation']
  ) {
    $automatically_approve_login = true;
  }
  return $automatically_approve_login;
}
add_filter( 'authorizer_automatically_approve_login', 'approve_all_faculty_logins', 10, 2 );
```


= 2.6.7 =
* Support LDAP URI in hostname field (e.g., ldaps://ldap.example.edu:636). Props @timkite for your contribution!
* Update translatable strings.
* Simplify CAS login routine.

= 2.6.6 =
* Fix for mixed line endings in phpCAS library, causing warnings when running PHP Compatibility Checker plugin. Props @wpgirl369/@eshannon3 for the pull request!
* Fix: Never block access to super admins (or admins in single site mode). Props @eizzumdm and @nreljin!
* Add user to network approved list when they are granted super admin privileges on the Edit User screen outside of Authorizer. Remove user from network approved list when this is revoked (and readd them to the approved list on any site they are currently a member of).
* Fix for notification emails sent to all site users if plugin wasn't correctly activated.
* Handle CAS servers that return an email address in response to phpCAS::getUser()

= 2.6.5 =
* Use wp_remote_get() instead of curl to check CAS server availability. php-curl is no longer a dependency.
* Fix for error introduced in last version with cacert.pem updating.

= 2.6.4 =
* Use wp_safe_remote_get() instead of file_get_contents() to update cacert.pem. Props @kriswme2!
* Fix error message shown when login form is first shown and LDAP is enabled. Props @akompanas!
* Fix for lengthy timeout if ldap_start_tls() fails when connecting to an LDAP server. Props @TJuberg!
* Fix a bug preventing first-time login of an approved user when a WordPress user already existed with the same username (but a different email address).
* Remove the spinner overlay when logging in via Google (user could accidentally close the Google sign-in popup, and the spinner prevented them from reopening it by clicking on the "Sign In with Google" button).
* Clean up plugin files (rename 'inc' directory to 'vendor').
* Fix for CAS version option being selectable when it's been multisite overridden.
* Fix for missing translatable string (anonymous access message in bootstrap dismissible alert).
* Show all roles in all sites on the Approved Users role dropdown in network admin.

* Feature: Sync role and email address in approved list when changed elsewhere.
* Feature: Add super admins to network approved list on plugin activation.
* Feature: Allow "no role for this site" selection for user roles.
* Fix for existing WordPress user logging in: make sure they are in the approved list.
* Fix for local (WordPress) authentication not respecting the blocked list.
* Fix for whitespace and "mailto:" in emails (trim when clicking approve button).
* Fix for external=wordpress safety login not working if option to immediately redirect to CAS is enabled.
* Fix for deprecation warning in WordPress 4.6: wp_get_sites().
* Fix for deprecation warning in WordPress 4.6: wp_new_user_notification().
* Fix for multisite users not being removed from pending lists.
* Improve code efficiency.

= 2.6.2 =
* Revert LDAP/CAS email domain guessing logic (some existing users rely on the old method to determine email address domains). If email domain or CAS/LDAP attribute containing email address is not specified in Authorizer options, guess that email domain is the last two components of the CAS/LDAP host when splitting by periods (e.g., authn.example.com would return an email domain of example.com).

= 2.6.1 =
* Tested up to WordPress 4.6.1.
* Update cacert.pem file.

= 2.6.0 =
* Tested up to WordPress 4.6.
* Feature: Add method for constructing email address for CAS/LDAP servers that don't return an email attribute. Simply enter @yourdomain.edu into the mail attribute field to have email addresses be constructed as username@yourdomain.edu.
* Fix: Updates to cacerts.pem for CAS servers now works for WordPress installs behind a proxy. Props dchambel! https://github.com/uhm-coe/authorizer/pull/13
* Feature: Allow restricting Google logins to a single Google Apps hosted domain (e.g., mycollege.edu).
* Update google-api-php-client from 1.0.5-beta to 1.1.5.
* Fix for REST API integration: Authorizer will now deny read/view access via the REST API if the site is private and the user is not authenticated. Other REST API access is unaffected by Authorizer, and is managed by the REST API authentication schema (cookie, oauth, or basic authentication). See [http://v2.wp-api.org/guide/authentication/](http://v2.wp-api.org/guide/authentication/) for details.
* Fix: Warn if php_openssl.dll is not installed on Windows servers (cannot update cacert.pem if it's missing).
* Fix for mcrypt key length error in php 5.6 and higher.
* Fix for broken newlines in notification emails (also update translations).
* Feature: Customize user roles based on CAS or LDAP attributes. Example:
```
/**
 * Filter the default role of the currently logging in user based on any of
 * their user attributes.
 *
 * @param string $default_role Default role of the currently logging in user.
 * @param array $user_data     User data returned from external service.

  }

}
add_filter( 'authorizer_custom_role', 'my_authorizer_custom_role', 10, 2 );
```

= 2.5.1 =
* Updated Spanish translations. Props @elarequi.

* Fix: Force lowercase emails from LDAP. Props @akompanas.
* Fix: Set some LDAP defaults likely to be the same on all installs : ldap_port, ldap_attr_username.

= 2.5.0 =
* Translations: Props to @elarequi for wrapping text strings in the translation functions and for providing Spanish translations.
	- Fichero authorizer.php: Se preparan todas las cadenas necesarias, para hacerlas traducibles.
	- Se crea el directorio /languages, con los ficheros de traducción.
* Translations: Props @jojaba for providing French translations.
